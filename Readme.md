# Baby-Emotion-Detector
Project Overview

The Baby Emotion Recognition System is an image classification model designed to identify and classify the emotional state of a baby based on facial expressions. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze grayscale images of babies' faces and predict emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise.

This project aims to provide a reliable and fast emotion recognition system that can be used in various applications, including monitoring baby emotions for medical, parenting, or entertainment purposes.
